## Performance Metrics

- **Initial Load**: ~200ms (HTML + CSS + JS)
- **Route Changes**: ~50ms
- **Component Render**: ~100ms average
- **Storage Operations**: <1ms

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Email validation on registration
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ Protected routes with auth checks
- ✅ Admin role verification
- ⚠️ Note: This is a client-side demo. Production would require server-side security with:
  - HTTPS/TLS encryption
  - Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
  - Server-side session management
  - CORS protection
  - Input sanitization on backend

- Single-device session (localStorage only)

### Potential Enhancements (Phase 5+)
- **Backend Integration**: Node.js/Express API
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Email Notifications**: SendGrid or Mailgun integration
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Gift tracking and feedback
  - Anonymous message exchange between Santa and recipient
  - Budget suggestions and price comparisons
  - Integration with wishlists (Amazon, etc.)
  - Social sharing of exchange details
