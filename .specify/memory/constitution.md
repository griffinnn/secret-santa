# Secret Santa Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity-First
Every feature MUST prioritize simplicity over sophistication. Choose the most straightforward implementation that meets requirements. Avoid over-engineering, complex abstractions, or premature optimization. When faced with multiple approaches, select the one that is easiest to understand, implement, and maintain.

**Rationale**: Quick development cycles and easy maintenance are more valuable than theoretical perfection for a Secret Santa application.

### II. Quick Hosting
The application MUST be designed for effortless deployment and hosting. Prefer static site generation, single-file deployments, or simple hosting solutions over complex infrastructure. All deployment processes MUST be documented and executable by non-technical users.

**Rationale**: Users should be able to quickly set up and host their own Secret Santa exchanges without technical barriers.

### III. Basic Testing (Focused Coverage)
Testing MUST focus on basic user flows rather than comprehensive coverage. Write tests for critical paths: user registration, gift assignment, and core exchange workflows. Skip testing for edge cases unless they represent common user scenarios.

**Rationale**: Balanced approach ensures reliability without over-testing less critical functionality.

### IV. Web-First Architecture
The application MUST be web-based with responsive design. Prioritize broad browser compatibility over cutting-edge features. Ensure functionality works on mobile devices and older browsers.

**Rationale**: Web applications provide the widest accessibility and require no app store distribution.

### V. Minimal Dependencies
Minimize external dependencies to reduce complexity and security surface area. Prefer native web technologies and small, well-established libraries over large frameworks. Each dependency MUST be justified by significant value add.

**Rationale**: Fewer dependencies mean easier maintenance, faster load times, and reduced security risks.

## Deployment Standards

The application MUST support multiple simple hosting options:
- Static file hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- Single-server deployment with minimal configuration
- Docker container deployment (single container)
- Clear documentation for each deployment method

All environment configuration MUST use simple files or environment variables. No complex configuration management systems.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
- All changes MUST be reviewed for simplicity and hosting compatibility
- Complex solutions MUST include justification for why simpler alternatives were rejected
- Deployment documentation MUST be updated when hosting requirements change

### Quality Gates
- Basic functionality tests MUST pass
- Application MUST be deployable via documented methods
- No unnecessary dependencies MUST be introduced without constitution compliance justification

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Any violation of core principles MUST be explicitly justified and documented. The application's primary goal is enabling easy Secret Santa exchanges, not showcasing technical complexity.

All pull requests MUST verify compliance with simplicity and hosting principles. When in doubt, choose the simpler path.
