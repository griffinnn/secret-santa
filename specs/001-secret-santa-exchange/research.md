# Research: Secret Santa Exchange Platform

**Feature**: Secret Santa Exchange Platform  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Complete

## Technology Decisions

### Decision: Vanilla JavaScript (No Framework)
**Rationale**: Aligns with Minimal Dependencies and Simplicity-First principles. Modern browsers provide sufficient native APIs for DOM manipulation, event handling, and client-side routing without requiring React, Vue, or Angular.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- React: Rejected due to build complexity and dependencies
- Vue: Rejected due to additional learning curve and setup requirements
- Svelte: Rejected due to compilation step requirement

### Decision: localStorage for Data Persistence  
**Rationale**: Perfect for GitHub Pages static hosting, no backend required, immediate data persistence, works offline. Sufficient for holiday-season usage patterns with small data volumes.

**Alternatives considered**:
- IndexedDB: More complex API, overkill for simple key-value storage needs
- External APIs: Would violate Quick Hosting principle requiring backend services
- File downloads: Poor user experience, no automatic persistence

### Decision: CSS Grid + Flexbox for Layout
**Rationale**: Modern, responsive, no external CSS frameworks needed. Excellent browser support and enables mobile-first design.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Bootstrap: Adds significant dependency weight
- Tailwind: Requires build process
- CSS-in-JS: Adds complexity without framework benefits

### Decision: Manual Testing Approach
**Rationale**: Aligns with Basic Testing principle focusing on core flows rather than comprehensive automation. Simple HTML test pages allow quick validation of main user journeys.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest/Mocha: Adds build complexity and testing infrastructure
- Playwright/Cypress: Overkill for basic functionality validation
- Unit test frameworks: Would require additional setup and maintenance

## Client-Side Architecture Patterns

### Decision: Module Pattern with ES6 Classes
**Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns without requiring build tools. Native browser support for ES6 modules enables component organization.

**Implementation approach**:
- Each model/service as separate JavaScript file
- ES6 classes for data models (User, Exchange, Assignment)
- Simple event-driven communication between components
- No complex state management - direct DOM manipulation

### Decision: Client-Side Routing with Hash Navigation
**Rationale**: Works perfectly with GitHub Pages static hosting, no server configuration needed for routes.

**Implementation approach**:
- Hash-based routing (#/dashboard, #/admin, #/exchange/123)
- Simple router function listening to hashchange events
- Progressive enhancement - works without JavaScript for basic functionality

## Christmas Theme Implementation

### Decision: CSS Custom Properties + Animations
**Rationale**: Native CSS features provide rich theming without JavaScript dependencies. Seasonal animations enhance user experience.

**Implementation approach**:
- CSS custom properties for color scheme (reds, greens, golds)
- CSS animations for subtle festive effects (snow, twinkling)
- Responsive design ensuring mobile compatibility
- Accessible color contrast ratios maintained

## Data Models Research

### Local Storage Schema Design
**Key findings**: Structure data to minimize localStorage calls and enable efficient querying:

```javascript
// Storage keys:
'secretsanta_users' - Array of user objects
'secretsanta_exchanges' - Array of exchange objects  
'secretsanta_assignments' - Array of assignment objects
'secretsanta_currentUser' - Current session user ID
```

### Gift Assignment Algorithm
**Research outcome**: Use Fisher-Yates shuffle with constraint checking to ensure no self-assignments and perfect matching.

**Algorithm approach**:
1. Create participant array
2. Shuffle recipients using cryptographically secure random
3. Validate no self-assignments
4. Retry if needed (rare edge case)
5. Store assignments with exchange ID reference

## GitHub Pages Deployment Research

### Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Direct main branch deployment with GitHub Actions for optimization

**Implementation approach**:
- Push to main branch triggers deployment
- Optional GitHub Action for asset minification
- Custom domain support through CNAME
- Progressive Web App manifest for offline capability

### Browser Compatibility
**Target support**: Modern browsers with graceful degradation
- Chrome 80+ (ES6 modules, localStorage)
- Firefox 75+ (CSS Grid, Flexbox)
- Safari 13+ (ES6 classes, fetch API)
- Edge 80+ (Modern standards compliance)

All research items have been resolved and technical decisions are ready for implementation.
