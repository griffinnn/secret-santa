# Tasks: Secret Santa Exchange Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-secret-santa-exchange/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per constitution's "Basic Testing" principle, focus on core user flows only. Tests are OPTIONAL unless basic functionality testing is explicitly requested.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md structure: Static web application with vanilla JavaScript components at repository root.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P2)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but may integrate for user flow
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Requires US1 (exchanges must exist) and US2 (participants must exist)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Requires US3 (assignments must exist) for meaningful dashboard content
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Component creation before integration
- Model logic before UI implementation
- Styling after functional implementation
- Error handling and validation last within each story

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - US1 and US2 can start in parallel
  - US5 can start in parallel with US1/US2
  - US3 waits for US1 and US2 to complete
  - US4 waits for US3 to complete
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Admin Creates Exchanges)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (User Registration and Participation)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test admin creating exchanges and users joining
6. Deploy/demo if ready - functional Secret Santa platform!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add US1 + US2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add US3 ‚Üí Test gift assignment ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Core functionality complete)
4. Add US4 ‚Üí Test participant experience ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhanced UX)
5. Add US5 ‚Üí Test deployment workflow ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Developer-friendly)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Admin functionality)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (User registration)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Deployment workflow)
3. After US1 and US2 complete:
   - Developer A or B: User Story 3 (Gift assignment)
4. After US3 completes:
   - Any developer: User Story 4 (Dashboard)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Focus on core functionality over comprehensive testing (per constitution)
- All paths are relative to repository root
- Maintain Christmas theme throughout implementation
- GitHub Pages compatibility is essential for all tasks
