# Feature Specification: Secret Santa Exchange Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-secret-santa-exchange`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the app will allow users to complete a very simple registration process and be added to a secret santa. Admin users should have the ability to create secret santas and make these available for sign up. The secret santa events should have configurable names and the ability to set a budget for the gifts. Whatever other features you think would be helpful are good but please do keep it simple and focus on fundamental functionality of the app. If possible add a christmas theme to it."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Admin Creates Secret Santa Exchange (Priority: P1)

An admin user creates a new Secret Santa exchange with a festive name and gift budget, making it available for participants to join. This establishes the foundation event that enables all other functionality.

**Why this priority**: Without an exchange to join, no other user stories can function. This is the core administrative capability that enables the entire platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an admin account, setting up a new exchange with name and budget, and verifying it appears in the available exchanges list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated admin user, **When** they create a new Secret Santa exchange with name "Office Holiday Party 2025" and budget "$25", **Then** the exchange is created and visible to potential participants
2. **Given** an admin creating an exchange, **When** they set a custom gift budget amount, **Then** participants see this budget guidance when joining
3. **Given** an admin user, **When** they save an exchange with Christmas-themed styling, **Then** the exchange displays with festive visual elements

### User Story 2 - User Registration and Exchange Participation (Priority: P1)

New users complete a simple registration process and join an available Secret Santa exchange, providing their basic information needed for gift matching.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary user flow that delivers immediate value - users can join and participate in exchanges.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by registering a new user account, browsing available exchanges, and successfully joining one with confirmation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new visitor, **When** they complete registration with name and email, **Then** they can browse and join available Secret Santa exchanges
2. **Given** a registered user, **When** they join a Secret Santa exchange, **Then** they are added to the participant list and receive confirmation
3. **Given** a user joining an exchange, **When** they provide their wish list preferences, **Then** this information is stored for their Secret Santa to view

---

### User Story 3 - Automatic Gift Assignment (Priority: P2)

The system automatically assigns Secret Santa matches when an admin activates the exchange, ensuring each participant gives to exactly one person and receives from exactly one person.

**Why this priority**: This automates the core Secret Santa logic, eliminating manual assignment work and ensuring fair distribution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having multiple users join an exchange, admin triggering assignment, and verifying each participant has exactly one assignment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Secret Santa exchange with multiple participants, **When** an admin triggers gift assignments, **Then** each participant is assigned exactly one person to give a gift to
2. **Given** completed gift assignments, **When** a participant views their assignment, **Then** they see their recipient's name and wish list preferences
3. **Given** active assignments, **When** the system processes matches, **Then** no participant is assigned to give a gift to themselves

---

### User Story 4 - Participant Dashboard (Priority: P3)

Participants can view their Secret Santa assignment details, including recipient information, gift budget, and exchange timeline in a festive, user-friendly interface.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience by providing a central hub for managing their Secret Santa participation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as a participant with an active assignment and verifying all relevant information is clearly displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a participant with an active assignment, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they see their recipient's name, preferences, and gift budget
2. **Given** a participant dashboard, **When** viewed during the holiday season, **Then** the interface displays Christmas-themed elements and colors
3. **Given** multiple exchange participations, **When** a user views their dashboard, **Then** they can see all their active Secret Santa assignments

---

### User Story 5 - Developer Setup and Deployment (Priority: P2)

Developers can quickly set up local development environment and deploy to GitHub Pages with minimal configuration, ensuring smooth development-to-production workflow.

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintaining the application and enabling easy hosting, directly supporting the constitutional principle of Quick Hosting.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by cloning the repository, running locally, making changes, and deploying to GitHub Pages within minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer with the repository, **When** they open the project locally, **Then** the application runs immediately without installation steps
2. **Given** code changes pushed to main branch, **When** GitHub Actions processes the deployment, **Then** the live site updates automatically within 2 minutes
3. **Given** the application running locally, **When** compared to the GitHub Pages version, **Then** functionality is identical across both environments

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an exchange has an odd number of participants?
- How does the system handle users who register but never join an exchange?
- What occurs if an admin deletes an exchange after participants have joined?
- How are duplicate email addresses during registration handled?
- What happens if a participant wants to leave an exchange after assignments are made?
- How does the application handle browser storage limits for large numbers of exchanges?
- What occurs if a user accesses the application from multiple devices with different local storage?
- How does the system handle GitHub Pages deployment failures or rollbacks?
